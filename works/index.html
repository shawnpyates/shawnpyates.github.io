    <p>For me, flashcards are an incredibly useful learning tool, but when it comes to learning new software technologies, I get very limited mileage out of currently existing flashcard apps due to their lack of support for Markdown code snippets. The backend for MD Flashcards is the first API I've written in Elixir/Phoenix, and the app has incidentally been a great help in bootstrapping my own Elixir learning journey.</p>
