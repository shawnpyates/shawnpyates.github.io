    "I am a Full Stack Software Developer based in the Vancouver area.",
    "I have a strong background in building real-time, scalable web applications in NodeJS and React, and I enjoy working at all levels of the stack. More recently, I have developed a growing interest in Functional Programming and have been enjoying my dive into the Elixir ecosystem. I strive to deliver solutions that are performant, secure, reusable, maintainable, readable, testable, and well-documented.",
    "When I'm away from my desk, you might find me cooking, being a casual outdoorsman, Netflix-binging, learning Korean, or playing with other people's dogs."
